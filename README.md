# monmon-website-monitor
MONMON is a small Python 3 console app that monitors websites for changes and alerts you both in the terminal (with colored diffs) and via a Discord webhook. You can watch the entire page or just a specific CSS selector (like you would copy from your browserâ€™s Inspect tool). Optional JS-rendered fetching is available via Playwright.
